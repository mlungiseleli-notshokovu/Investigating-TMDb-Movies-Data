# Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program
# Investigating the TMDb Movies Data - Wrangling & Analysis

## **About the project**
In this project, I have to choose any one Dataset for investigation out of 4. 

I have chosen TMDb Movie Data for my Investigation in this project.

## **What needs to be done**
For the this project, I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share my findings. 
I will start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorm what questions I could answer using it. 
Then i will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
I have not been required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I will make it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative.
This project is open-ended in that they aren't looking for one right answer.

## **Why this project**
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 
I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! 
Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## **Data**
## **Files**
This project contains 3 files:

- tmdb-movies.csv : The dataset file containing 10k+ entries of movies that I have worked on.
- Investigate_a_TMDb Movies Data.ipynb : The investigation of the dataset has been done in this jupyter notebook file.
- Investigate_a_TMDb Movies Data.pdf : containing HTML file of notebook.

Dataset file
- This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). 
- It contains columns such as title, cast, director, runtime, budget, revenue, release year etc.

- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Nothing to care much of, I leave them as is.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj" show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
